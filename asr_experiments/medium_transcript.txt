Technology, as we all know, moves incredibly fast.  Yet strangely enough, our ability to adapt often lags behind.  Think about it, just 10 years ago, who would have imagined that we'd be talking to machines  on a daily basis?  From sending quick voice notes to asking, what's the weather today?  We've grown comfortable with digital assistance.  Still questions remain, can they truly understand context?  Do they recognize the difference between sarcasm and sincerity?  Or between an excited shout and a frustrated sigh?  More importantly, can they handle diverse accents, like mine, without skipping a beat?  These details, commas, pauses, even the occasional dash, are what make speech feel human.  Accuracy is one thing, but natural rhythm, that subtle flow of thought is what separates  good transcription from great conversation.
